= Exploratory Test Record: Create Computer

The table below captures the runs of exploratory testing needed for this piece of application functionality.

. `Run Number` is a unique ID for each run. 
.. It will be recorded on every JIRA issue raised during the testing.
. `Description` captures what is being tested or retested.
. `Retest needed?` is a `yes` or `no` answer.
.. `yes` = defects were found that will be fixed and need retesting.
.. `no` = no defects were found that will be fixed or the service was mocked out.
. `Screen Recording` is the location of the output of a screen capture tool that was running while the exploratory tests were being performed.

NOTE: The screen recordings are usually only kept for 6 months to a year, depending on the frequency of releases.
